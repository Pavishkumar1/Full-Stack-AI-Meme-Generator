# Meme Generator with GPT-4

## Overview

This project is an automated meme generator that utilizes the GPT-4 API for text generation and an image generation API for creating visuals. The application is designed to create memes based on user-defined prompts or randomly generated ideas, making meme creation easy and fun!

## Features

- **Automated Meme Generation:** Generate memes with text and images in a streamlined process.
- **Custom Prompts:** Specify themes or subjects for memes (e.g., cats, computers).
- **Open Source:** The program is written in Python and will be available in executable (EXE) format for easier use.
- **Twitter Bot Integration:** A fully automated Twitter account generates and posts memes every six hours.

## Requirements

- **OpenAI API Key:** Required for accessing GPT-4 for text generation. Create an account and follow the instructions to obtain your API key.
- **ClipDrop Account (Optional):** Recommended for better image generation. You can also use OpenAI for image prompts, but ClipDrop provides superior results.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine.
2. **API Keys Setup:**
   - Locate the `api_keys` file created during the first run.
   - Input your OpenAI API key and (if applicable) your ClipDrop API key.
3. **Run the Program:** Execute the program to start generating memes. The application will create necessary configuration files on first run.

## Usage

1. **Run the Application:** Launch the program.
2. **Input Prompt:**
   - Enter a specific theme or leave it blank for a random meme.
   - Specify the number of memes to generate or default to one.
3. **Output:** The generated memes will be saved in an `outputs` folder, with a log file documenting the generated content.

## Configuration Options

- **Basic Instructions:** Set general guidance for the types of memes to create.
- **Image Instructions:** Customize the style of images (e.g., photographic, illustrative).
- **Advanced Settings:** Adjust parameters such as:
  - **Text Model:** Choose between GPT-4 and GPT-3.5.
  - **Temperature:** Control the randomness of the output.
  - **Font Selection:** Specify a custom font for meme text.
